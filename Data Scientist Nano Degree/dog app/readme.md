# Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project

The goal of this project is to use a CNN to classify dog breeds. The steps are the classification of an image as a dog or a human,later, a prediction of which dog breed the dog is if classified as a dog, or which dog breed the human most look like. If the image is detected  neither as a dog nor as a human, the classifier will not say it.
